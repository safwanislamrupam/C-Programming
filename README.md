What is C?
C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

Why Learn C?

If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
If you know C, you will understand how computer memory works
C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies
